""" scorekeeper
pre: expects the wrapped function to have scores_window deque, 
scores list and an episode_index defined.
expects: wrapped function is iterating over an episode and accumulating score totals, and its
return value is the accumulated total over the episode.
post: will add the score totals returned from the wrapped func to an array and a windowed deque, 
and it will report to std out at set intervals (currently not configurable) what the average score was
returns: None, since the calling function of func doesn't expect a return, this is side-effecting
