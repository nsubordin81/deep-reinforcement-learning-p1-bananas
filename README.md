# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Program Project One: Navigation

## Environment Details

The environment for this task consists of observations with  a state space vector of 37 dimensions which provides the agent with information such as their velocity as well was a ray trace that shoots out and helps them to detect and identify objects along their forward movement vector in 3d space. 

There is an action space consisting of only 4 possible actions, numbered 0 to 3. these correspond to movements the agent can take in the 3d world, either forward, backward, left or right. 

The task is episodic rather than continuous, so within an episode for an optimal policy the agent select the appropriate action in each time step to maximize the number of yellow bananas it collects based on its observations, while also minimizing the number of blue bananas it collects. 

Specifically, the task will be considered 'solved' when the agent is able to maintain an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.
